## Certaficats Generator
    a simple python app that allows you to generate certaficats to your clients, and send each certaficats to it's owner via email, this porject was made for the summer school event by Open Minds Club.

## How to use ?
    - usage is simple, depends on your usage:
        - First you need to check out the scripts and see what u need to modify depends on your purposes ( the csv file location, the html & css file, the class name that u want to capture, the tags that u want to modify ...., this process will be automated soon)
    
    - after that u need to create a `.env` file where u need to store your 16 digit password that used to send the emails and your email as well (2FA is a must!)

## requirements :
    there is some requirements that u need to install, u can do that simply by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Important note:
    I am using `touch` to create fiels cause I'm using a unix based system, if u have another os, feel free to open a PR
